Visual Studio Code Testing

This is a React Template that I am using in Visual Studio Code to learn react through VS code. Download if you like. Thanks!

To create react app do the following in VS Code:

To install the create-react-app generator, in a terminal or command prompt type:

npm install -g create-react-app
This may take a few minutes to install. You can now create a new React application by typing:

create-react-app my-app
where my-app is the name of the folder for your application. This may take a few minutes to create the React application and install its dependencies.

Let's quickly run our React application by navigating to the new folder and typing npm start to start the web server and open the application in a browser:

cd my-app
npm start
You should see "Welcome to React" on http://localhost:3000 in your browser. We'll leave the web server running while we look at the application with VS Code.

To open your React application in VS Code, open another terminal or command prompt window, navigate to the my-app folder and type code .:

cd my-app
code .
